# Worldwide_Petroleum_Resource_Map
I want to give user a general impression of the world wide petroleum resource distribution. So I decided to use map. Then I use different color to draw the circle on the graph and show their differences. User can also chose different country and zoom in if they want to hover the circle and get more infomation of the site.
I choose checkbox and dropdown menu. So people are easly use. And the combination of these two can also give user a better vision of how petroleum is distribute.
